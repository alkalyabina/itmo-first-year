# Notebooks

My IHaskell notebooks, containing mostly homework assignments and some rudimentary
automation for things we are expected to do by hand (looking at you, dept of physics).

Preview via Jupyter Notebook Viewer is available [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thymelous/ifmo/tree/master/notes/).
